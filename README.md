## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/moviegenerator.git
   cd moviegenerator
```

2. **Set Up the Database**

Create a MySQL database named movies_db.
Run the following SQL script to create the required table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE saved_movies (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  poster TEXT NOT NULL,
  overview TEXT NOT NULL
);
```
3. **Configure the Backend**

Ensure your PHP environment is set up (e.g., using XAMPP, WAMP, or a similar tool).
Place the project files in your server's root directory (e.g., htdocs for XAMPP).
Update the database credentials in save.php, delete.php, and saved.php if necessary:
```php
$host = "localhost";
$user = "root";
$pass = "";
$db = "movies_db";
```

4. **Set Up TMDb API**

Sign up at TMDb and get your API key.
Replace the placeholder API_KEY in script.js with your actual API key:
```javascript
const API_KEY = "your_api_key_here";
```

5. **Start the Application**

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost/moviegenerator/index.html.
